## Todo List

## Description
In this code I made a Todo List website.
The user can make your list.
Assign a category, deadline and priority to each item.
And naturally, the user can cross the corresponding item after the task is done.

## How to run
run following:
```bash
python -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
